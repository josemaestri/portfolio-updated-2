    <h2 class="h3">About Me</h2>

    <p>I am a self-starting front end web developer of 5 years, who currently just finished an intensive 6-month full-stack web developer bootcamp at the University of Miami, looking to work on new and impactful projects or for startups in the blockchain, food &amp; beverage, entertainment &amp; media, or travel industries.</p> 

    <p>I've spent most of career working with teams large and small, locally and virtually. Well-versed in HTML, CSS (via SCSS) and JS (including jQuery), I put a large emphasis on user friendly design. For building full-stack applications and websites, I am familiar with NodeJS, PHP, ColdFusion, MySQL, MongoDB, and React.</p>

    <p>I enjoy learning and working on front-end design principles, as well as building and utilizing API’s to be used for new projects or applications. I believe strongly in efficient teams, healthy business-client dynamics, and shared commitment to goals and projects.</p>
    {{!-- <p>I like people. I like music. I like fun. I don't do boring. I am a simple man who is easily amused. The world is my playground. The Internet is my sandbox. I use it to work, to play, to learn, and to connect. I try to bring that out in my work. The web should reflect the world around us, not just the one in our screens.</p>

    <p>I am but a humble developer and designer. Always learning, and always with the zeal and enthusiasm of a pupil eager to further develop his craft. I will never claim to know it all (and am wary of those who do), but I will never back down from a challenge; the proverbial comfort zone scares me more than the unknown. And to be honest, anyone who doesn't share that fear with me doesn't stick around for long.</p>
